<h4> Technology </h4>
<p> We plan to use <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-creation">Unity 2D</a>
to make the game </p>

<h4> Game Elements </h4>
<ul>
    <li> For investing in securitites, there will be a high volatility, medium volatitilty,
         and low volatitily, we're very upfront about this information. We use some randomness
         in the returns for each security, and tell you how much you would have made had you
         invested in the other securities.</li>
    <li> For "fighting" the IRS, you use a slider to determine how much you're going to pay
         on each income bracket, and you need to get the right range to satisfy the agent</li>
    <li> The first time you "fight" the IRS agent, you cannot lose - if you give the wrong
         amount in taxes, the agent will scold you, but you won't lose points or anything.
         As you play more and more, the hints disappear and you have consequences.
         For instance, after playing for awhile the IRS agent will stop shouting the
         percentage. If you under pay the agent you get fees, if you overpay then you
         can't invest your money and you don't get it back until later. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Levels </h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        There is the general in between open world level where you can travel from
        the stock trading area to home, and talk to people.
    </li>
    <li> There is the stock trading area where you can invest in securities </li>
    <li> There is the first IRS level where the IRS agent is very explicit about
         how you should pay your taxes </li>
    <li> There is the advanced IRS level where paying your taxes is difficult </li>
</ul>
Describe three levels - one elementary level (potentially tutorial) and
two intermediate levels, next to each other in difficulty.
