<p> [Taxes game] is a Pokemon-style open-world 2D game in which players learn to manage
their finances by investing in simple securities and performing their civic
duty by paying their taxes via graduated income tax.</p>

<h4> Technology </h4>
<p> We plan to use <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-creation">Unity 2D</a>
to make the game. </p>

<h4> Game Elements </h4>
<ul>
    <li> For investing in securities, there will be high volatility, medium volatitilty,
         and low volatitily options (this information will be made very clear to users). We use some
         randomness in the returns for each securit and tell you how much you would have made had
         you invested in the other securities.</li>
    <li> For "fighting" the IRS, you use a slider to determine how much you're going to pay
         on each income bracket, and you need to get the right range to satisfy the agent.</li>
    <li> The first time you "fight" the IRS agent, you cannot lose - if you give the wrong
         amount in taxes, the agent will scold you, but you won't lose points.
         As you play more and more, the hints disappear, and your choices have consequences.
         For instance, after playing for a while the IRS agent will stop giving the
         percentage. If you underpay the agent you get fined, but if you overpay then you
         can't invest your money, and you don't get it back until later. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Levels </h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        There is the general in-between open world level where you can travel from
        the stock trading area to home, and talk to people.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is the stock trading area where you can invest in securities.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the first IRS level, the IRS agent is very explicit about how you should pay your taxes.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the advanced IRS level, paying your taxes is more difficult because the scaffold
        (the IRS agent's help in accounting for your taxes) is taken away.
    </li>
</ul>
