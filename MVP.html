<h4> Technology </h4>
<p> We plan to use <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-creation">Unity 2D</a>
to make the game </p>

<h4> Game Elements </h4>
<ul>
    <li> For investing in securitites, there will be a high volatility, medium volatitilty,
         and low volatitily, we're very upfront about this information. We use some randomness
         in the returns for each security, and tell you how much you would have made had you
         invested in the other securities.</li>
    <li> For "fighting" the IRS, you use a slider to determine how much you're going to pay
         on each income bracket, and you need to get the right range to satisfy the agent</li>
    <li> The first time you "fight" the IRS agent, you cannot lose - if you give the wrong
         amount in taxes, the agent will scold you, but you won't lose points or anything.
         As you play more and more, the hints disappear and you have consequences.
         For instance, after playing for awhile the IRS agent will stop shouting the
         percentage. If you under pay the agent you get fees, if you overpay then you
         can't invest your money and you don't get it back until later. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Levels </h4>

</ul>
